# CursedAudioMaze

Small cli game using curses with maze and tilt mazes in which you navigate by ear.

To install the dependencies, use

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To launch the game, use

```python
python main.py
```

Optional: to create your own mazes, you can use the tkinter python script `maze_creator.py` (left click on two cells to create wall, right click to define beginning cell and middle click to create exit). You will need to install the additional dependency `tkcap` to do this.
